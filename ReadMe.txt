Project "Sentiment Analysis of Twitter for Mapping of Stock Market Movement"

With the emergence of a large number of social media platforms, one may  wonder whether opinions expressed on these platforms could influence the stock market movement. Our project was completed in two phases. The first phase aims to train a classifier that can annotate tweets based on the sentiment expressed in it. In the second phase, we developed a website to display the results of the first phase via interactive graphs.

Some of my responsibilities included the following:-
1. Scrapping tweets from Twitter using tweepy,a python-twitter API.
2. Gathering Stock market data from Quandl. Fill in missing values using interpolation.
3. Preprocessing the collected data.
4. Extracting useful features from collected tweets.
5. Train a ML model to successfully classify tweets into positive, negative and neutral based on the emotions expressed in it.
6. Developed website to present results from above analysis
